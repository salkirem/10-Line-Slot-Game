With the power of these symbols, you have the chance to trigger exciting free games, retrigger them, and even witness the enchanting WILDs stick around to boost your wins.

Game Rules:

    Symbols: There are 11 regular symbols, each with its own unique charm, and 2 special symbols - the WILD and the scatter.

    WILD: The WILD symbol is your key to greater wins. It appears on all reels and can replace any regular symbol to complete winning combinations.

    Scatter: The scatter symbol is represented by a magical amulet. It appears on the first 3 reels in both base and free games.

    Free Games: Land 3 scatter symbols anywhere on the reels to trigger 10 free games. The scatters must appear on the first 3 reels to activate this feature.

    Retrigger: During free games, if you manage to land 3 scatter symbols again, you can retrigger the free games feature up to two times. This gives you additional chances to uncover enchanted winnings.

    Sticky WILDs: In the free game rounds, whenever a WILD symbol lands, it becomes sticky and remains in place until the end of the free games. Watch as these magical WILDs contribute to spellbinding combinations.

    Multiplier Magic: The game introduces a multiplier system that enhances your wins. When a spin results in a payout, the next spin's payout will be multiplied by the current multiplier. The multiplier starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each successful payout spin. If a spin doesn't yield a payout, the multiplier resets to 1. The maximum multiplier is 10.

    Volatility: The game's volatility adds excitement to your spins. With 2 million rounds simulated, you'll experience the highs and lows of this enchanting world.
